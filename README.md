Devlog:
I have increased the map area by three times approximately. The new added map has a checkpoint to make the game more reliable and can be passed. There is a new enemy that need more shots to be fixed. Also, there is a new type of damager that you will discover. There are some damagers and health collectables exist as the same of the first level. Also, there is more than one way to make the game more fun!
